# Synthetic Small Dataset

This folder contains the **small synthetic JSON Schemas and instances** used for validating
the BiJect transformations in lightweight scenarios.

## Contents

| Schema ID  | File Path      | Instances                       |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| schema1    | schema1.json   | instance1.json, instance2.json  |

## Notes

- Small-scale schemas with limited reuse.
- Designed for initial validation and quick experiments.
- Minimal nested structures to illustrate basic factorization/inlining.

## Metadata

- Authors: Zouhaier Brahmia and Fabio Grandi
- Purpose: Reproducibility, validation, and performance evaluation of bidirectional JSON Schema transformations
