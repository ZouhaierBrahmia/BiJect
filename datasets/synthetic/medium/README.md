# Synthetic Medium Dataset

This folder contains the **medium synthetic JSON Schemas and instances**, designed
to illustrate more realistic reuse scenarios across multiple entities.

## Contents

| Schema ID  | File Path      | Instances                       |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| schema1    | schema1.json   | instance1.json, instance2.json  |

## Notes

- Medium-scale schema with **multiple entities**: User, Supplier, Order.
- Reuse of common structures such as Contact and Address.
